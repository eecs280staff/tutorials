macOS command line tools
========================
{: .primer-spec-toc-ignore }

macOS comes with a Terminal and can run UNIX command-line tools directly.

When you see `$` in this tutorial, you should type into your shell the command that comes after the `$`.

## Open terminal
macOS has a built-in shell.  Open the Terminal application.

## Install compiler
Install a compiler.
```console
$ xcode-select --install
```
{: data-variant="no-line-numbers" }

Notice that this compiler is really Apple LLVM pretending to be `g++`.  Your version might be different.
```console
$ g++ --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

## Install package manager
Install the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/).
```console
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
{: data-variant="no-line-numbers" }

<div class="primer-spec-callout warning" markdown="1">
Apple Silicon users ("M1" or "M2") only - Homebrew installs to a non-standard location, `/opt/homebrew/`. You'll need to run the following to add Homebrew to your path:

```console
$ echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
$ eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
{: data-variant="no-line-numbers" }
</div>

## Install CLI tools
Use the Homebrew package manager to install a few command line programs.
```console
$ brew install wget git tree
```
{: data-variant="no-line-numbers" }

## Pro-tips

### CLI open file
Simulate a double-click from the command line in the Terminal.
```console
$ open babychickens.jpg
```
{: data-variant="no-line-numbers" }
