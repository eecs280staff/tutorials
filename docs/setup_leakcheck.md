Leaking Checking
========================
{: .primer-spec-toc-ignore }

This tutorial explains how to check for memory leaks in C/C++ programs on different platforms.

FIXME: which platform do you have?

## Prerequisites
This tutorial relies on command line tools.  If you haven't installed CLI tools on your machine yet, follow one of these tutorials first.

| [macOS](setup_macos.html)| [Windows](setup_wsl.html) | [Linux](setup_wsl.html#install-cli-tools)

We're also assuming you are familiar with a text editor or IDE.  If you haven't already done so, follow one of these tutorials.

| [VS Code (recommended)](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html)| [Visual Studio](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_visualstudio.html) | [Xcode](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_xcode.html) |

Finally, you'll need to be familiar with the command line interface (CLI).  If you haven't seen it yet, take a look at the [Command Line Tutorial](cli.html).
